            <li>3 tablespoons plus ¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>1 large yellow onion, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 pound Italian parsley (about 3 large bunches)</li>
            <li>1 pound cilantro (about 3 large bunches)</li>

            <li>¼ teaspoon crumbled saffron threads</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add onion; cook and stir until deep golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in turmeric for 1 to 2 minutes. 
                Add chuck cubes; cook until coated in turmeric and browned on all sides, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a separate pot over medium heat. 
                Add spinach, green onions, parsley, cilantro, chives, and fenugreek leaves; cook and stir until deep dark green in color, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir spinach mixture into onion and chuck mixture. Pour in enough water to create a slurry consistency. Season with salt and pepper. 
                Stir in lemon juice. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer stew until greens soften, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Pierce dried limes with a fork; add to stew. Continue simmering until chuck is tender, 30 minutes to 1 hour. Stir in red kidney beans.
